The meet/pants server needs to:
===============================

[DONE] - 971991: accept auth token and simple push URL.
[DONE] - 971993: store user ID to push URL mapping(s). NEED TO DO REAL STORAGE IN A MEMCACHE DB.
[DONE] - 971994: generate temporary session URIs to send to unregistered users.
[DONE] - 971995: extract and validate information from temporary URI.
- 974317: Server needs to accept a new incoming call
- 971999: Server needs to service request from client to list pending incoming calls
- 971996: interface with partner servers to acquire room and partcipant tokens.
- 971997: store room and participant tokens in database.

Technical stuff not in bugs
===========================

- test the storage.
- check if that's possible to do ACLs on "everything"
- rename calls in calls/url
